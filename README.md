This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a comprehensive dataset of ultra-marathon events, encompassing various attributes related to races, participants, and their performances. The primary goal is to clean the data, derive meaningful insights, and visualize key trends.

The project begins with importing necessary libraries, such as pandas and seaborn, for data manipulation and visualization. The dataset is then loaded into a pandas DataFrame. Initial data filtering is performed to focus on specific race distances (50km and 50mi) and locations (USA) for the year 2020.

Feature engineering steps include creating new features like athlete age and cleaning existing ones, such as correcting data types and handling missing values. Irrelevant columns are removed to streamline the dataset, ensuring only pertinent information is retained.

To uncover trends and patterns, various visualizations are generated. Histograms display the distribution of race lengths and athlete performance, while violin plots and regression plots offer insights into the comparison of performance between male and female athletes and analysis of athlete average speed by age group.

Key insights from the analysis include identifying performance trends among different age groups and genders and highlighting significant differences in speed for 50km and 50mi races. This project lays a solid foundation for further analysis and could be extended to include predictive modeling or more complex statistical analyses.
